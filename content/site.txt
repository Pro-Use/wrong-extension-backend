Title: Wrong Extension Backend

----

Extabout: <p>arebyte Plug-in<br>arebyte browser extension for The Wrong Biennale 2021/22</p><p>For the 2021/2022 edition of The Wrong Biennale, arebyte presents arebyte plug-in a new way to experience the works and exhibition in the biennale via a browser plug-in. The plug-in brings the magnitude and unique breadth of exhibitions and works featured in The Wrong Biennale to be presented as a series of pop-up windows including images, audio, video and 3D digital worlds directly to the viewer’s browser.</p><p>The works are displayed as pop-up windows and are disseminated to the viewer over the duration of a week, their size, frequency and contents all to be decided by the curators of each presentation. Viewing selected contents from the Biennale in this way makes traversing the works easier for those who have less time, or want a new experience of The Wrong for 2021. It also applies a more progressive way of viewing digital content online, and provides an artistic ‘stopping cue’ from relentless scrolling, email notifications and other computer-centered work.</p><p>To launch The Wrong, arebyte will curate the first pop-up exhibition for highlighting works developed and created during the Paraspaces 2021 as part of the residency with the Goldsmiths computing department students.</p><p>The connected works are an experiment in distributed online spaces, and provide insights into multi-layered interests in the paraspace cartography arena including mapping, neural-nets, first-person gaming and bots.</p><p>Each week over the course of the Biennale, a new curator will be selected by arebyte and The Wrong Curatorial team to curate and present their own existing Embassy and Pavilion on the plug-in.</p><p>The plug-in was initially developed by arebyte for Real-Time Constraints , a group exhibition in 2020</p>
